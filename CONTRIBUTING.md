## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example Code Style

```python
def format_statusline(session_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """
    Format session data into a compact statusline string.
    
    Args:
        session_data: Dictionary containing session information
        
    Returns:
        Formatted statusline string
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

Example test:
```python
def test_format_statusline_with_active_session():
    """Test statusline formatting for an active session."""
    session_data = {
        'model': 'Opus 4.1',
        'active': True,
        'message_count': 100
    }
    result = format_statusline(session_data)
    assert 'LIVE' in result
    assert 'Opus 4.1' in result
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
- Comment complex logic
